Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a beautiful princess named Isabella. She had long golden hair, big blue eyes, and a smile that could light up a room. Isabella lived in a magnificent castle with her parents, the king and queen of the land.

One day, a fierce dragon attacked the castle and set it ablaze. The king and queen were trapped inside, and Isabella knew she had to act fast. She climbed to the top of the tower and called out for help. Just when all hope seemed lost, a brave knight named Richard arrived and defeated the dragon with his sword.

Isabella and Richard fell in love and were married in a grand ceremony at the castle. They ruled the land together and lived happily ever after.
